  "observations": [
    "GitHub repository at https://github.com/J-MaFf/gitconfig",    "Owned by Joey Maffiola (7maffiolajoey@gmail.com)",
    "Local path: $env:USERPROFILE\\Documents\\Scripts\\gitconfig (portable)",
    "Purpose: Git configuration files and helper scripts for managing Git aliases and branch maintenance",
    "Designed to be symlinked from home directory for easy access and version control",
    "Windows-only (PowerShell scripts), Python 3.6+ compatible",
    "Added scheduled task creation functionality to Initialize-Symlinks.ps1 - creates 'GitConfig Pull at Login' task to run Update-GitConfig.ps1 at user login",
    "Renamed pull-daily.ps1 to Update-GitConfig.ps1 following PowerShell approved naming conventions",
    "Created Register-LoginTask.ps1 script for manual scheduled task registration",
    "Made entire repository portable using environment variables ($env:USERPROFILE, %USERPROFILE%) instead of hardcoded paths",
    "Added portability requirements section to copilot-instructions.md emphasizing use of environment variables and relative paths",
    "Updated .gitconfig gpg program path and safe directory paths to use %USERPROFILE% for cross-user/cross-machine compatibility",
    "Update-GitConfig.ps1 now uses $env:USERPROFILE for repository path default parameter",
    "All scripts tested to work across different user accounts and computers",
    "Scheduled task runs silently in background at Windows login to keep repository synchronized",
    "Repository structure: Contains .gitconfig, gitconfig_helper.py, scripts folder, docs folder, .github folder, .vscode folder, and knowledge-graph.jsonl",
    "Core files: .gitconfig (Git configuration), gitconfig_helper.py (Python utility), README.md (documentation), .gitignore (pull-daily.log excluded)",
    "Scripts directory contains: Initialize-Symlinks.ps1, Register-LoginTask.ps1, Update-GitConfig.ps1",
    "Recent refactoring: Renamed pull-daily.ps1 to Update-GitConfig.ps1 following PowerShell approved verb conventions",
    "Python dependency: rich library required (auto-installs if missing), Python 3.7+ required",
    "Git aliases configured: 'git alias' (list all aliases), 'git branches' (download remote branches), 'git cleanup' (delete merged branches)",
    "SSH signing: Configured with OpenSSH ed25519 key format using 1Password SSH agent (op-ssh-sign.exe)",
    "Safe directories: Network paths (10.210.3.10 and KFWS9BDC01) configured for permission handling",
    "Initialize-Symlinks.ps1: Creates symlinks for .gitconfig and gitconfig_helper.py, supports -Force and -Help flags, prompts user to create login scheduled task",
    "Register-LoginTask.ps1: Manual task registration script, uses $env:USERPROFILE for portability",
    "Update-GitConfig.ps1: Scheduled task script that runs 'git pull' at user login, logs to pull-daily.log, uses $env:USERPROFILE for repo path",
    "Scheduled task 'GitConfig Pull at Login': Configured to run silently at user login, automatically syncs repository",
    "All scripts use environment variables ($env:USERPROFILE, %USERPROFILE%) for cross-machine portability",
    "gitconfig_helper.py: Contains cleanup_branches() and print_aliases() functions, auto-installs rich dependency if missing",
    "Machine-agnostic design: Repository paths use environment variables allowing deployment across multiple computers with different usernames",
    "Git configuration features: Auto-setup remote tracking, custom editor (VS Code with --wait), safe directory declarations",
    "Installation requirements: Python 3.7+, rich library, PowerShell 5.1+, Administrator privileges for symlink creation",
    "Documentation: README.md includes setup instructions, usage examples, troubleshooting, and configuration details",
    "Version control: knowledge-graph.jsonl tracked in Git for backup and sync purposes",
    "Workflow: Clone repository, run Initialize-Symlinks.ps1 with admin privileges, install rich library, verify with 'git alias' command",
    "Daily updates: Update-GitConfig.ps1 runs automatically at login via scheduled task to keep repository synchronized",
    "Testing: Git aliases verified with 'git alias' command, symlinks tested with proper ls commands",
    "Development guidelines emphasize: Portability first, never hardcode paths, use environment variables, maintain Python 3.6+ compatibility",
    "Branch management: cleanup_branches() function handles both merged branches (remote deleted) and local-only branches (--force flag)",
    "Known limitations: Windows-only PowerShell scripts, administrator privileges required for symlinks, network paths may need environment-specific updates",
    "Architecture: Portable design with symlinked configuration files allows same repo to serve multiple machines"
