maintenance","Designed to be symlinked from home directory for easy access and version control","Windows-only (PowerShell scripts), Python 3.6+ compatible","Added scheduled task creation functionality to Initialize-Symlinks.ps1 - creates 'GitConfig Pull at Login' task to run Update-GitConfig.ps1 at user login","Renamed pull-daily.ps1 to Update-GitConfig.ps1 following PowerShell approved naming conventions","Created Register-LoginTask.ps1 script for manual scheduled task registration","Made entire repository portable using environment variables ($env:USERPROFILE, %USERPROFILE%) instead of hardcoded paths","Added portability requirements section to copilot-instructions.md emphasizing use of environment variables and relative paths","Updated .gitconfig gpg program path and safe directory

machines","Repository directory reorganized for better structure (2025-12-15)","Created config/ folder for configuration files (pester.config.ps1 moved there)","Moved BRANCH_PROTECTION.md to docs/
